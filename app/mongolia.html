      <h2>Spring Snow</h2>
      <p class="author">Eun Hee Kyung</p>
      <p>
        I’ll never forget the day I first saw Botticelli's The Birth of Venus. A late spring snow was coming
        down. As I followed my father into the carpeted Italian restaurant, I realized it was a world apart from
        any place I’d ever known. Each table was set with its own dainty flower vase and candlesticks, and the air
        in the room was quietly stirred by the subdued conversations of affluent, refined-looking people skilfully
        handling Western-style silverware. My father and I were shown to a reserved table beside a window. A
        waiter took my father’s elegant overcoat and my old, lumpy parka and hung them on a coat stand.
      </p>
      <p>
        As soon as I sat down across from him, I kept my eyes on the large painting dimly lit by a
        spotlight on the wall behind him. I couldn’t look directly at him. The restaurant was warm, and sweat
        soon began to ooze along my neck. “Now that you’re a middle school student,” he said, “you must do
        more for your mother.” I nodded almost imperceptibly in response to Father’s words. “You can call me
        anytime.” That sounded like a lie. When the food came out, I lowered my eyes and pretended to be
        absorbed in eating. Father dipped a shrimp in sauce and placed it on my plate. “You have a healthy
        appetite,” he said. “But don’t worry. The fat will melt off on its own when you grow up. When I was
        your age, my nickname was Dumpling.” That sounded like a lie too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once we’d finished eating and the plates were cleared away, I had nowhere to focus my eyes, so
        I gazed up at the painting again. Father turned to see what I was looking at. A refined smile rose to his
        lips. “That’s Venus,” he said. “The scene where she’s born out of the sea foam.” Why did I feel so sad
        the moment I heard those words? Was it because of the smooth, beautiful face like that of a porcelain
        doll, milky-hued with a touch of green? Or the long, blond hair wrapped around her slender, naked body
        and fluttering in the breeze, or the defenseless-looking, bare, white feet poised on a great gaping shell?
        Or was it because of the mysterious sorrow deep in her eyes as she gazed up into the empty air? “I’m
        sorry,” Father said mournfully, when he saw that my eyes were brimming with tears.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking back now, I realize that, as I followed my father around that day, I was tormented by
        the question of why I was born. Each time I fell behind, he had to stop and wait for me to catch up,
        probably thinking all the while, just as everyone else did, that I was slow because I was big. I was already
        used to that kind of misunderstanding. Because I was fat, everyone thought I looked angry or unhappy all
        the time, when in fact I was merely shy. On the days I met Father, I always went home feeling sad
        because I was convinced I could never please him. My fatness seemed to bother him. Had I been clever
        and innocent, he would have been the tragic hero, but a fat kid who looks stupid or crabby could never
        amount to anything more than a reminder of his own mistake, his one moment of folly.
